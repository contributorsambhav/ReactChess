      "description": "This puzzle was composed by Ottó Bláthy in 1922. This involves a lot of chess thinking in terms of strategy, tactics, moves & ideas. White has just one pawn and a king whereas, black has all his pieces. But still White can win this game. White needs to find the best moves & ideas in which white can trap black in the corner and checkmate the black king. This is a really interesting & unique puzzle and we can learn some important chess concepts out of this brilliant endgame composition. This will help us in move calculation & emphasize on the idea of restriction in chess.",
